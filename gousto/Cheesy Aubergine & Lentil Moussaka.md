# Cheesy Aubergine & Lentil Moussaka

**Cooking time:** 55 mins

## Ingredients:

- 15ml soy sauce
- 35g grated Italian hard cheese
- 1 tsp dried oregano
- 1 can of lentils
- 1 vegetable stock cube
- 5g parsley
- 400g potatoes
- 40g mature cheddar
- 1/2 tsp ground cinnamon
- 2 garlic cloves
- 1 tbsp tomato paste
- 1 can of chopped tomatoes
- 1 aubergine
- 1 red onion
- butter
- flour
- milk

## Instructions:

- Preheat the oven to 200°C/ 180°C (fan)/ 395°F/ Gas 6
  Boil a kettle
  Slice the potatoes into thin discs
  Add the potato discs to a pot of boiling water with a pinch of salt, bring to the boil over a high heat and cook for 7-8 min or until almost tender
  Once done, drain, set aside to steam dry and reserve the pot

- Meanwhile, trim the green stalks off the aubergine[s] and cut into quarters lengthways, then slice finely
  Heat a large, wide-based pan with a very generous drizzle of olive oil over a high heat
  Add the sliced aubergine and cook for 2-3 min on each side or until charred and beginning to soften

- Meanwhile, peel and finely chop the red onion[s]
  Transfer the softened aubergine to a plate and return the pan to a medium heat with a drizzle of olive oil
  Once hot, add the chopped onion with a pinch of salt and cook for 4-5 min or until beginning to soften

- Meanwhile, re-boil a kettle
  Peel and finely chop (or grate) the garlic
  Dissolve the vegetable stock cube[s] in 150ml [250ml] boiled water
  Drain and rinse the canned lentils

- Once the onion has softened, add the chopped garlic, dried oregano, tomato paste and ground cinnamon and cook for 30 sec
  Return the softened aubergine to the pan and add the drained lentils, chopped tomatoes, vegetable stock and soy sauce
  Give everything a good mix up and bring to the boil over a high heat
  Once boiling, reduce the heat to low and cook until step 7

- Return the reserved pot to a medium heat with 30g [60g] butter
  Once melted, add 30g [60g] flour and stir with a wooden spoon for 1-2 min until a sandy paste forms – this is your roux
  Gradually whisk 350ml [700ml] milk into the roux, a little at a time and cook for 5-7 min or until a smooth, thick sauce remains
  Season generously with salt – this is your béchamel sauce

- Transfer the aubergine & lentil mix to an oven-proof dish
  Top with the drained potatoes then pour the béchamel sauce all over
  Grate the cheddar cheese all over and top with the grated Italian hard cheese
  Put the dish in the oven for 15-20 min until bubbling and golden
  Meanwhile, chop the parsley roughly

- Serve the aubergine & lentil moussaka and garnish with the chopped parsley
