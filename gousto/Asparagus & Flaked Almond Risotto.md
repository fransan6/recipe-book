- Preheat the oven to 200°C/ 180°C (fan)/ gas 6 and boil a kettle

- Add the reserved asparagus tips to one side of a baking tray, drizzle with olive oil and season with a pinch of salt
  Put the tray in the oven for 5-6 min or until the asparagus tips are nearly cooked and tender
  After 5-6 min add the flaked almonds to the other side of the tray and cook for a further 2-3 min or until golden and toasted

- Once cooked, remove the risotto from the heat and stir in the grated cheese and a knob of butter
