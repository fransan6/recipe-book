# Harissa Lentil Ragù With Herby Greek Cheese Mash

**Cooking time:** 35 mins

## Ingredients:

- 1 courgette
- 1 green lentils
- 200g finely chopped tomatoes
- 1 green lentils
- 100g Greek salad cheese
- 5.5g vegetable stock mix
- 1 harissa paste
- 4 white potatoes
- 10g parsley & mint
- 1 garlic clove
- 1 red onion
- milk

## Instructions:

- Boil a full kettle
  Chop your potatoes into bite-sized pieces
  Add the chopped potatoes to a pot with plenty of boiled water and a generous pinch of salt and bring to the boil over a high heat
  Once boiling, reduce the heat to medium and cook for 12-15 min or until fork-tender, then drain and return to the pot to steam dry

- Whilst the potatoes are cooking, peel and finely dice your red onion[s]
  Heat a large, wide-based pan with a drizzle of olive oil over a medium-high heat
  Once hot, add the diced onion with a pinch of salt and cook for 3-4 min or until softened
  Meanwhile, peel and finely chop (or grate) your garlic

- Once the onion has softened, add the chopped garlic and cook for 1-2 min further
  Top, tail and chop your courgette[s] into quarters lengthways, then slice finely

- Add the sliced courgette to the garlic and onion and cook for 3-4 min or until the courgette has started to soften
  Drain and rinse your green lentils

- Dissolve your vegetable stock mix and your harissa paste in 150ml [195ml] [250ml] boiled water – this is your harissa stock
  Once the courgette has softened, add the harissa stock and chopped tomatoes and cook for 10 min
  Add the drained green lentils and cook for 2-3 min or until the sauce has thickened to a bolognese-like consistency – this is your harissa lentil ragù

- Whilst the ragù is cooking, strip your mint leaves from their stems and chop them finely, discard the stems
  Chop your parsley finely, including the stalks

- Return the potatoes to a low heat with a splash of milk
  Crumble in half of your Greek cheese and add half of the chopped parsley and mint
  Mash until smooth – this is your herby Greek cheese mash

- Serve the herby Greek cheese mash on a plate, make a well in the centre and fill with the harissa lentil ragù
  Crumble over the remaining Greek cheese and sprinkle over the remaining chopped parsley and mint
