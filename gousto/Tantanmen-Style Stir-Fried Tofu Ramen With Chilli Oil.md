# Tantanmen-Style Stir-Fried Tofu Ramen With Chilli Oil

**Cooking time**: 30 mins

## Ingredients:

- 200g pak choi
- 15ml rice vinegar
- 30g white miso paste
- 2 wholewheat noodle nests
- 15g fresh root ginger
- 1/2 tsp cayenne pepper
- 20ml toasted sesame oil
- 30g tahini
- 20g hoisin sauce
- 30ml soy sauce
- 280g plain tofu
- 1 spring onion
- 2 garlic cloves
- sugar

## Instructions:

- Boil a full kettle
  Combine the toasted sesame oil and cayenne pepper in a small bowl, give everything a good mix up and set aside for later – this is your chilli oil

- Peel and finely chop (or grate) the ginger
  Peel and finely chop (or grate) the garlic

- Drain and pat the tofu with kitchen paper until completely dry
  Heat a large, wide-based pan (preferably non-stick) with a generous drizzle of vegetable oil over a medium-high heat
  Once hot, crumble the tofu directly into the pan and cook for 5-6 min or until golden
  Once golden, add the chopped ginger and garlic and cook for 1-2 min further or until fragrant

- Whilst the tofu is cooking, add the miso paste, rice vinegar, half the soy sauce (save the rest for later!) and 1 tsp [2 tsp] sugar to a pot with 800ml [1.4L] boiled water over a medium heat and cook for 3-4 min, stirring well to combine

- Meanwhile, wash then cut the pak choi in half, discard the roots
  Add the wholewheat noodles to the pot and cook for an initial 4 min or until the noodles are almost cooked
  Tip: Separate the noodles with a fork so that they're all submerged in the broth
  After an initial 4 min, add the halved pak choi and cook for 2-3 min further or until the noodles are cooked and the pak choi is tender

- Once fragrant, add the remaining soy sauce and hoisin sauce to the pan with the tofu and cook for 1-2 min or until sticky – this is your stir-fried tofu
  Meanwhile, trim, then slice the spring onion[s] finely

- Once the noodles are cooked, carefully remove the pak choi from the pot and set aside for serving
  Add the tahini to the pot with the noodles and give everything a good mix up until the soup is creamy and has thickened slightly – this is your miso sesame ramen
  Tip: Stir the noodles to release their starch and give the soup a nice creamy texture

- Serve the wholewheat noodles in deep bowls and pour the miso sesame ramen over the top
  Top with the pak choi, stir-fried tofu and sliced spring onion – this is your tantanmen-style stir-fried tofu ramen
  Drizzle the chilli oil all over
