# Mac 'N' Peas With Zingy Seasonal Salad

**Cooking time:** 40 mins

## Ingredients:

- 30g grated Italian hard cheese
- 30g panko breadcrumbs
- 11g vegetable stock mix
- 1 seasonal salad
- 5.5g Dijon mustard
- 160g blanched peas
- 150g macaroni
- 10g basil
- 80g cheddar cheese
- 1 garlic clove
- 1 lemon
- butter
- flour
- milk

## Instructions:

- Preheat the oven to 220°C/ 200°C (fan)/ gas 7 and boil a kettle
  Add your macaroni to a pot of boiled water and bring to a boil over a high heat
  Cook for 8-10 min or until cooked with a slight bite
  Once done, drain the cooked macaroni

- Meanwhile, grate your cheddar cheese finely
  Dissolve your vegetable stock mix in 200ml [300ml] [400ml] milk and 100ml [150ml] [200ml] boiled water – this is your creamy stock
  Melt 15g [22g] [30g] butter in a pot over a medium heat
  Once melted, add 15g [22g] [30g] flour and stir with a wooden spoon for 1 min or until a sandy paste forms – this is your roux

- Gradually whisk the creamy stock into the roux, a little at a time, and cook for 5-6 min or until a smooth, thick sauce remains
  Once you have a thick sauce, stir through your Dijon mustard and half the grated cheddar then season with a good grind of black pepper – this is your béchamel sauce

- Peel your garlic and add it to a food processor with your basil, grated Italian hard cheese, 3 tbsp [4 1/2 tbsp] [6 tbsp] cold water, blanched peas and the juice of half your lemon[s]
  Blitz until well combined and semi-smooth – this is your pea pesto

- Add your panko breadcrumbs and the remaining grated cheddar to a small bowl with a grind of pepper – these are your cheesy breadcrumbs
  Add the drained macaroni to the béchamel sauce – this is your pasta mixture

- Transfer the pasta mixture to an oven-proof dish
  Mix through the pea pesto then top with the cheesy breadcrumbs
  Put the dish in the oven for 15-20 min or until it's golden – this is your mac 'n' peas

- Meanwhile, wash your seasonal salad, then pat dry with kitchen paper
  Add the seasonal salad to a bowl with a squeeze of lemon juice and give everything a gentle mix up – this is your zingy seasonal salad
  Cut the remaining lemon into wedges
