- 25g red chilli relish
- 15ml tamari soy sauce

## Instructions:

- Boil a full kettle
  Heat a large, wide-based pan (preferably non-stick) with 1 tbsp [2 tbsp] vegetable oil over a high heat
  Once hot, add the plant-based mince to the pan and cook for 4-5 min or until starting to brown, breaking it up with a wooden spoon as you go

- Whilst the meat-free mince is browning, top, tail, peel and grate the carrot[s]
  Combine the sriracha and rice vinegar in a bowl with a pinch of sugar and 1 tbsp [2 tbsp] water
  Add the grated carrot, then give it a good mix up and set aside – this is your spicy carrot quick-pickle

- Squeeze the pouch[es] of cooked white long grain rice to separate the grains
  Tear the top corner of the pouch[es] and microwave for 2 min or until piping hot

- Meanwhile, wash then add the spinach to a colander and pour boiled water all over it so that it starts to wilt
  Rinse the wilted spinach under cold running water until it’s cool
  Once the spinach is cool, squeeze as much water out of it as you can, then add it to a bowl with half of the toasted sesame oil – this is your sesame spinach

- Once the meat-free mince has browned, add the ginger & garlic paste and cook for 1 min
  Add the chilli relish, tamari soy sauce and remaining toasted sesame oil and give it a good mix up – this is your meat-free mince bulgogi

  Garnish with the toasted sesame seeds
