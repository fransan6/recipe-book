**Cooking time**: 35 mins

## Ingredients:

- 32g tomato paste
- 390g chickpeas
- 1 tbsp ras el hanout
- 5.5g vegetable stock mix
- 30g pine nut & seed mix
- 40g harissa paste
- 130g bulgur wheat
- 80g spinach
- 5g mint
- 1 aubergine
- 2 tomatoes
- 1 red onion

## Instructions:

- Preheat the oven to 220°C/ 200°C (fan)/ gas 7
  Trim the green stalk off your aubergine[s], then chop into bite-sized pieces
  Add the chopped aubergine to a baking tray with a generous drizzle of olive oil and a pinch of salt
  Put the tray[s] in the oven for 25 min until the aubergine is soft and golden

- While the aubergine is cooking, boil a full kettle
  Dice your tomato[es]
  Peel and finely chop your red onion[s]
  Dissolve your vegetable stock mix in 250ml [350ml] [450ml] boiled water

- Heat a large, wide-based pan (preferably non-stick) with a drizzle of olive oil over a medium heat
  Once hot, add the chopped onion and cook for 5 min or until softened

- Add your bulgur wheat to a pot with plenty of boiled water
  Bring to the boil over a high heat and cook for 7-9 min or until tender with a slight bite
  Drain and return to the pot
  Once the onion has softened, add your ras el hanout to the pan with your tomato paste and cook for 1 min or until fragrant

- Once fragrant, add the diced tomato, vegetable stock and harissa paste and cook for 5-10 min or until reduced to a thick sauce
  Meanwhile, reboil a kettle, then drain and rinse your chickpeas
  Once the sauce has thickened, add the drained chickpeas and cook for a further 2-3 min or until combined – this is your harissa & chickpea stew

- Add your spinach to a colander and pour over the boiled water so that it starts to wilt
  Rinse the wilted spinach under cold running water until cool
  Squeeze as much water out of the spinach as you can and chop it roughly, then add to the pot with the cooked bulgur wheat
  Season with a pinch of salt and pepper – this is your spinach bulgur

- Once the aubergine is soft and golden, push it to one side of the tray[s] and add your pine nut & seed mix to the other side, then return the tray[s] to the oven for 3-4 min or until toasted
  Meanwhile, strip your mint leaves from their stems and chop them finely (save some leaves for garnish!), discard the stems
  Once the seeds are toasted, remove the tray[s] from the oven, then stir the roasted aubergine into the harissa & chickpea stew

- Serve the roasted aubergine, harissa & chickpea stew with the spinach bulgur to the side
  Garnish with the toasted pine nut & seed mix, chopped mint and reserved mint leaves
