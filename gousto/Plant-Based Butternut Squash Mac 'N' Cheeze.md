# Plant-Based Butternut Squash Mac 'N' Cheeze

**Cooking time:** 35 mins

## Ingredients:

- 160g butternut squash cubes
- 30g sun-dried tomatoes
- 250ml creamy single oat
- 30g panko breadcrumbs
- 11g vegetable stock mix
- 1 seasonal salad
- 40g mature cheddar style block
- 15ml balsamic vinegar
- 150g macaroni
- 10g basil
- 2 garlic cloves
- 1 brown onion

## Instructions:

- Preheat the oven to 200°C/ 180°C (fan)/ gas 6
  Peel and finely dice your brown onion[s]
  Peel and finely chop your garlic
  Heat a large, wide-based pan with a drizzle of olive oil over a medium heat
  Once hot, add the diced onion with a pinch of salt and cook for 4-5 min or until softened

- Meanwhile, boil a full kettle
  Add your butternut squash to a pot of boiled water with a large pinch of salt and bring to the boil over a high heat
  Cook the butternut squash for an initial 5 min or until starting to soften
  Once the onion has softened, add the chopped garlic and cook for 1-2 min further or until fragrant

- Once the butternut squash has softened, add your macaroni and cook both for 10 min further or until the butternut squash is fork-tender and the pasta is cooked with a slight bite
  Once done, drain the macaroni and butternut squash in a colander
  Meanwhile, chop your sun-dried tomatoes in half
  Pick your basil leaves from their stalks and finely chop the stalks
  Grate your cheddar flavour block

- Carefully transfer the butternut squash from the colander into a food processor, leaving the macaroni in the colander
  Add the softened onion & garlic to the food processor with your single oat and blitz until you're left with a smooth sauce – this is your creamy butternut squash sauce

- Return the drained macaroni to the pot over a medium-low heat and add the creamy butternut squash sauce with your vegetable stock mix, chopped basil stalks and grated cheddar flavour block and cook for 2-3 min until the sauce has thickened slightly

- Add the mix to an oven-proof dish and top with your basil leaves
  Sprinkle over your panko breadcrumbs and then add the halved sun-dried tomatoes and drizzle over a little olive oil
  Put the dish in the oven and cook for 15-20 min or until golden and crispy – this is your butternut squash mac 'n' cheeze

- Meanwhile, combine your balsamic vinegar with 2 tbsp [3 tbsp] [4 tbsp] olive oil in a small bowl
  Give it a good mix up – this is your balsamic dressing
  Wash your seasonal salad, then pat them dry with kitchen paper
