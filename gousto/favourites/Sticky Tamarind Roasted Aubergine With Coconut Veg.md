**Cooking time**: 30 mins

## Ingredients:

- 5g toasted sesame seeds
- 25g roasted peanuts
- 50g agave nectar
- 20g coconut flakes
- 10ml toasted sesame oil
- 1/2 tsp dried chilli flakes
- 130g basmati rice
- 30ml tamari soy sauce
- 15g ginger & garlic paste
- 15g tamarind paste
- 25g solid creamed coconut
- 80g spinach
- 80g fine green beans
- 1 aubergine

## Instructions:

- Preheat the oven to 220°C/ 200°C (fan)/ gas 7
  Trim the green stalks off the aubergine[s] and chop lengthways into 6 [12] wedges
  Transfer the aubergine wedges to a baking tray (or two) and toss in the toasted sesame oil
  Put the tray[s] in the oven for an initial 20 min or until the aubergine is tender and lightly golden

- Meanwhile, add the basmati rice and 300ml [600ml] cold water to a pot with a lid and bring to the boil over a high heat
  Once boiling, reduce the heat to very low and cook, covered, for 10-12 min or until all the water has been absorbed and the rice is cooked
  Once cooked, remove from the heat and keep covered until serving

- While the rice is cooking, combine the tamarind paste with the agave, ginger & garlic paste, 3/4 of the tamari soy sauce and the chilli flakes in a small bowl
  Give everything a good mix up – this is your sticky tamarind marinade

- Crush the roasted peanuts in their bag with a glass oil bottle
  Combine the crushed peanuts, toasted sesame seeds and coconut flakes in a small bowl – this is your nut & seed mix

- Once the aubergine is tender, remove the tray[s] from the oven and coat the aubergine in the sticky tamarind marinade
  Sprinkle over the nut & seed mix and return the tray[s] to the oven for 4-5 min further or until the nuts are golden – this is your sticky tamarind roasted aubergine

- Meanwhile, boil half a kettle
  Heat a large, wide-based pan with a drizzle of vegetable oil over a high heat
  Trim the green beans
  Once hot, add the trimmed green beans and cook for 1-2 min or until starting to brown

- Chop the creamed coconut roughly (if required)
  Dissolve the chopped creamed coconut and the remaining tamari soy sauce in 100ml [200ml] boiled water – this is your coconut stock
  Wash the spinach, then pat it dry with kitchen paper
  Once the green beans are starting to brown, add the spinach and the coconut stock to the pan and cook for 1-2 min further or until the spinach has wilted and the sauce has slightly reduced – this is your coconut veg

- Serve the sticky tamarind roasted aubergine over the basmati rice
  Serve the coconut veg to the side and drizzle any remaining coconut sauce from the pan all over
