# Spiced Cauliflower With Spinach & Tamarind Dal

**Cooking time**: 35 mins

## Ingredients:

- 1 tsp ground paprika
- 1 tsp ground turmeric
- 1 tbsp garam masala
- 1/2 tsp ground fenugreek
- 11g vegetable stock mix
- 1/2 tsp dried chilli flakes
- 30g tamarind paste
- 1 cauliflower
- 120g spinach
- 25g blanched almonds
- 1 brown onion
- 100g red lentils

## Instructions:

- Preheat the oven to 200°C/ 180°C (fan)/ gas 6
  Boil a kettle
  Cut the cauliflower into small florets

- Add the cauliflower florets to a baking tray with the ground paprika, a drizzle of vegetable oil and a generous pinch of salt
  Give everything a good mix up and put the tray in the oven for 20-30 min or until the cauliflower is golden and crisp – this is your spiced cauliflower

- Whilst the cauliflower is cooking, peel and finely slice the brown onion[s]
  Heat a large, wide-based pan (preferably non-stick) with a drizzle of vegetable oil over a medium heat
  Once hot, add the sliced onion and cook for 4-5 min or until starting to soften

- Meanwhile, dissolve the vegetable stock mix and tamarind paste in 600ml [1.1L] boiled water – this is your tamarind stock
  Reboil a kettle
  Wash the spinach, then add to a colander and pour boiled water all over until it starts to wilt
  Rinse the wilted spinach under cold running water, then squeeze as much water out of the spinach as you can and chop it roughly

- Once the onion has softened, add the garam masala, ground fenugreek, ground turmeric and chilli flakes to the pan and cook for 1 min or until fragrant

- Meanwhile, rinse the red lentils in a sieve under cold running water
  Once fragrant, add the rinsed lentils, chopped spinach and tamarind stock, then reduce the heat to medium-low and cook for 25-30 min or until the lentils are cooked and the sauce has thickened – this is your spinach & tamarind dal

- While the dal is cooking, add the blanched almonds to a baking tray and put them in the oven for 5 min or until they've darkened slightly in colour
  Once done, set them aside to cool before chopping roughly

- Serve the spiced cauliflower over the spinach & tamarind dal
  Sprinkle over the chopped toasted almonds
