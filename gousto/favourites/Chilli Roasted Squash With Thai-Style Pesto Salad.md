## Instructions:

- Preheat the oven to 200°C/ 180°C (fan)/ gas 6
  Boil a kettle
  Drain and rinse your chickpeas

- Add your butternut squash cubes and drained chickpeas to a baking tray
  Drizzle with olive oil and season with a pinch of salt
  Put the tray[s] in the oven and cook for an initial 15-20 min or until the squash is starting to soften

- Add your bulgur wheat to a pot with plenty of boiled water and a pinch of salt
  Bring to the boil over a high heat and cook for 7-9 min or until tender with a slight bite
  Once cooked, drain and return to the pot

- Meanwhile, chop your basil roughly, including the stalks
  Strip your mint leaves from their stems, then chop them finely and discard the stems
  Chop your coriander finely, including the stems

- Add half your roasted peanuts to a pestle & mortar with your ginger paste, chopped basil and half the chopped mint and chopped coriander
  Add a generous pinch of salt and grind to a thick paste
  Add your toasted sesame oil, rice vinegar and 1 tbsp [1 1/2 tbsp] [2 tbsp] water and mix it all together (use food processor) – this is your Thai-style pesto

- Combine your chilli flakes with the juice of your lime[s] and your soy sauce in a small bowl – this is your chilli & lime marinade
  Once the squash has had 15-20 min, remove the tray[s] from the oven and drizzle the chilli & lime marinade all over
  Return the tray[s] to the oven for 10-15 min further or until the squash is cooked through and the chickpeas are crisp – this is your chilli roasted squash

- While the squash is cooking, peel and finely slice your shallot[s]
  Wash your rocket, then pat it dry with kitchen paper
  Add the sliced shallot, rocket, and remaining chopped mint and remaining chopped coriander to the cooked bulgur and give it a good mix up – this is your bulgur salad
  Roughly chop the remaining roasted peanuts
