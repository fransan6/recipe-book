# Plant-Based Aubergine & Butternut Squash Risotto

**Cooking time:** 30 mins

## Ingredients:

- 160g butternut squash cubes
- 11g vegetable stock mix
- 15g pine nuts
- 20g pea shoots
- 15ml balsamic vinegar
- 160g arborio rice
- 15ml Chinese rice wine
- 5g basil
- 2 garlic cloves
- 1 aubergine
- 1 brown onion
- 1 lemon

## Instructions:

- Preheat the oven to 220°C/ 200°C (fan)/ gas 7 and boil a full kettle
  Slice the aubergine[s] in half lengthways, keeping the green stalk[s] on
  Score the aubergine flesh in a criss-cross pattern, then add the aubergine halves to a baking tray with a generous drizzle of olive oil and a pinch of salt
  Put the tray in the oven for an initial 15 min

- Whilst the aubergine is cooking, peel and finely chop the brown onion[s]
  Heat a large, wide-based pan with a drizzle of olive oil over a medium heat
  Once hot, add the chopped onion with a pinch of salt and cook for 3-4 min or until softened

- Meanwhile, peel and finely chop (or grate) the garlic
  Dissolve the vegetable stock mix in 700ml [1.4L] boiled water
  Once softened, add the arborio rice to the pan with the chopped garlic and Chinese rice wine and cook for 1 min
  Add the vegetable stock a ladle at a time, stirring continuously, for 25-30 min or until all of the stock is absorbed and the rice is cooked

- Once the aubergine has had an initial 15 min, remove the tray[s] from the oven and press the aubergine flesh down firmly with a fork to release the juices
  Add the butternut squash cubes to the tray with a drizzle of olive oil
  Return the tray[s] to the oven for 15 min further or until the aubergine flesh has softened and the butternut squash is tender

- Heat a separate large, dry, wide-based pan over a medium-low heat
  Once hot, add the pine nuts and cook for 2-3 min until lightly toasted
  Once toasted, transfer them to a plate and set aside

- Once the aubergine is tender, scoop the softened flesh out of the skins with a fork and discard the skins
  Add the softened aubergine flesh and half the toasted pine nuts to a food processor with the juice of 1/2 [1] lemon, a grind of black pepper and a drizzle of olive oil
  Blitz until smooth – this is your aubergine purée

- Once the rice is almost cooked, stir through the aubergine purée with a pinch of salt and pepper and cook for a further 2-3 min
  Tear in the basil leaves and gently mix everything together – this is your aubergine risotto
  Slice the remaining lemon into wedges
  Wash the pea shoots, then pat them dry with kitchen paper

- Serve the aubergine risotto topped with the roasted butternut squash
  Garnish with the remaining toasted pine nuts and the pea shoots, then season with a few grinds of black pepper
  Drizzle the balsamic vinegar and a little olive oil over the pea shoots and serve the lemon wedges to the side
