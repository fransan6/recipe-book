## Instructions:

- Now, let's get started!
  Preheat the oven to 220°C/ 200°C (fan)/ gas 7
  Boil a kettle
  Heat a large, wide-based, hob-safe oven-proof casserole dish with a matching lid with a drizzle of olive oil over a high heat

- In a pan, cook your butternut squash cubes with the ginger and garlic pastes
  Chop your tomato[es] and chilli and add

- Chop your creamed coconut roughly
  Dissolve the chopped creamed coconut and vegetable stock mix with 350ml [525ml] [700ml] boiled water - this is your coconut stock

- Add ground turmeric, curry powder and bay leaf[ves] to the pan and give everything a good mix up

- Transfer pan contents to the casserole dish, adding the (crushed) cardamon pods

- Add your basmati rice with the coconut stock
  Cover with a lid and put the dish in the oven for 25-30 min or until all the water has absorbed, the squash is fork-tender and the rice is cooked

- Once the rice is cooked, remove the dish from the oven and set aside for 5 min to steam – this is your baked butternut squash biryani
  Chop your coriander roughly, including the stalks

- To serve, fluff the baked butternut squash biryani with a fork, stir through the chopped coriander and season with a generous pinch of salt and pepper
