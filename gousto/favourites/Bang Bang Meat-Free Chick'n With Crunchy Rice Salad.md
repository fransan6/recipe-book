# Bang Bang Meat-Free Chick'n With Crunchy Rice Salad

**Cooking time:** 30 mins

## Ingredients:

- 10g toasted sesame seeds
- 1 red chilli
- 15ml rice vinegar
- 160g meat-free chick'n
- 10ml toasted sesame oil
- 1 tsp five-spice mix
- 1 soy sauce
- 100g white long grain rice
- 26g smooth peanut butter
- 1 carrot
- 1/2 cucumber
- 1 gem lettuce
- 2 spring onions
- 24ml soy sauce

## Instructions:

- Boil half a kettle
  Rinse your white long grain rice until the water runs clear, then add it to a pot with a lid with 175ml [230ml] [350ml] cold water and bring to the boil over a high heat
  Once boiling, reduce the heat to very low and cook, covered, for 12-15 min or until all the water has absorbed and the rice is cooked, then remove from the heat and set aside (lid on) to steam until serving

- While the rice is cooking, wash and shred your gem lettuce finely, then pat dry with kitchen paper
  Top, tail, peel, then grate your carrot[s]
  Trim, then slice your spring onion finely
  Add the shredded lettuce, grated carrot and sliced spring onion to a large mixing bowl

- Slice the cucumber into discs
  Slice each individual cucumber disc into matchsticks
  Cut half of your red chilli[es] into rounds
  Add the cucumber matchsticks and chilli rounds to the bowl with the lettuce, carrot and spring onion – this is your crunchy salad

- Heat a large, wide-based pan with a drizzle of vegetable oil over a medium-high heat
  Once hot, add your meat-free chick'n with a pinch of salt and pepper and cook for 3-4 min on each side, or until warmed through

- Cut the remaining chilli in half lengthways and chop finely
  Combine your peanut butter and 1 tbsp [1 1/2 tbsp] [2 tbsp] boiled water in a bowl and mix well until you have a smooth paste
  Add your soy sauce, toasted sesame oil, rice vinegar, chopped chilli and 1 tsp [1 1/2 tsp] [2 tsp] sugar and mix well to combine – this is your peanut dressing

- Once warmed through, reduce the heat to medium-low and sprinkle your five-spice over the meat-free chick'n
  Give everything a good mix up until the meat-free chick'n is evenly coated in the spice and cook for 1 min further or until fragrant

- Transfer the cooked meat-free chick'n to a clean board and shred apart using two forks – this technique is known as 'pulling'
  Once shredded, season the pulled meat-free chick'n with a pinch of salt – this is your bang bang meat-free chick'n
  Fluff the cooked rice with a fork and add it to the crunchy salad – this is your crunchy rice salad
  Toss the crunchy rice salad in a drizzle of olive oil and season with a crack of black pepper

- Serve the bang bang meat-free chick'n over the crunchy rice salad and drizzle the peanut dressing all over – this is your bang bang meat-free chick'n with crunchy rice salad
  Garnish with a sprinkling of toasted sesame seeds
