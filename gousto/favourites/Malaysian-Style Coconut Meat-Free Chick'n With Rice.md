# Malaysian-Style Coconut Meat-Free Chick'n With Rice

**Cooking time:** 25 mins

## Ingredients:

- 1 red chilli
- 15ml rice vinegar
- 1 tsp ground turmeric
- 160g meat-free chick'n
- 15ml soy sauce
- 130g basmati rice
- 15g ginger & garlic paste
- 15g tamarind paste
- 25g solid creamed coconut
- 1 fresh lemongrass stalk
- 1/2 cucumber
- 25g blanched almonds
- 1 shallot
- butter

## Instructions:

- Add the basmati rice and 300ml [600ml] cold water to a pot with a lid and bring to the boil over a high heat
  Once boiling, reduce the heat to very low and cook, covered, for 10-12 min or until all the water has absorbed and the rice is cooked
  Once cooked, remove from the heat and keep covered until serving

- While the rice is cooking, bash the lemongrass stalk[s] with a rolling pin, remove the tough outer layers and discard, then chop the softer inner core[s] finely
  Peel and roughly chop the shallot[s]
  Chop 1/2 [1] the red chilli[es] roughly, and finely slice the rest into rounds
  Put everything into a food processor

- Add the blanched almonds and half the ground turmeric to the food processor with 2 tbsp [4 tbsp] vegetable oil
  Add the soy sauce, ginger & garlic paste and a pinch of sugar
  Pulse until you're left with a slightly chunky paste – this is your Malaysian-style spice paste

- Boil half a kettle, then heat a large wide-based pan with a drizzle of vegetable oil over a medium-high heat
  Once hot, add the meat-free chick'n to the pan and sprinkle over the remaining ground turmeric and a pinch of salt and pepper
  Cook for 2-3 min or until warmed through and starting to brown

- While the meat-free chick'n is cooking, cut the cucumber[s] in half lengthways and then slice finely

- Add the sliced cucumber to a bowl with the rice vinegar, 1 tsp [2 tsp] sugar and a generous pinch of salt
  Stir it all together and set aside until serving – this is your quick-pickled cucumber

- Add the Malaysian-style spice paste to the meat-free chick'n and cook for 2-3 min or until fragrant
  Once fragrant, add the tamarind paste with 200ml [300ml] boiled water and cook for a further 2-3 min
  Chop the creamed coconut roughly (if required), then add it to the pan and cook for 1 min further – this is your Malaysian-style coconut meat-free chick'n
