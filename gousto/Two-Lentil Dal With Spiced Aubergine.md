# Two-Lentil Dal With Spiced Aubergine

**Cooking time**: 45 mins

## Ingredients:

- 80g cultured coconut
- 1 tbsp ground cumin
- 390g green lentils
- 1 tbsp garam masala
- 15g fresh root ginger
- 11g vegetable stock mix
- 5g coriander
- 3 garlic cloves
- 1 aubergine
- 100g red lentils
- 1 red onion

## Instructions:

- Preheat the oven to 220°C/ 200°C (fan)/ gas 7
  Trim the green stalk[s] off the aubergine[s] and cut into quarters lengthways, then chop into big pieces
  Rub the chopped aubergine with a drizzle of olive oil and the ground cumin, then season with salt

- Heat a large, wide-based pan with a drizzle of olive oil over a high heat
  Once hot, add the seasoned aubergine and cook for 1 min on each side or until browned
  Transfer the browned aubergine to a baking tray and put it in the oven for 20-25 min or until cooked through – this is your spiced aubergine

- While the aubergine is cooking, boil half a kettle
  Peel and finely chop (or grate) the garlic
  Peel and finely chop (or grate) the ginger
  Peel and dice the red onion[s]

- Return the pan to a medium heat with a drizzle of olive oil
  Once hot, add the diced onion with a pinch of salt
  Cook for 5 min or until softened
  Add the chopped ginger, chopped garlic and garam masala and cook for a further 3 min

- Rinse the red lentils in a sieve under cold water
  Add the red lentils and green lentils (no need to drain) to the softened onion
  Dissolve the vegetable stock mix in 350ml [550ml] boiled water
  Add the vegetable stock to the lentils and cook for 15-20 min, stirring occasionally, until all the water is absorbed and the lentils are tender and porridge-like in consistency

- Meanwhile, chop the coriander finely, including the stalks

- Once the lentils are cooked, remove them from the heat and stir in 2/3 of the cultured coconut, 2/3 of the chopped coriander (save the rest for garnish) and a grind of pepper – this is your two-lentil dal
  Taste for seasoning, adding more salt and pepper if needed

- Serve the two-lentil dal in bowls topped with the spiced aubergine
  Garnish with the remaining chopped coriander and a dollop of the remaining cultured coconut
