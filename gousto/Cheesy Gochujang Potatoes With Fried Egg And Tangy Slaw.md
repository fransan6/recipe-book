# Cheesy Gochujang Potatoes With Fried Egg And Tangy Slaw

**Cooking time**: 30 mins

## Ingredients:

- 5g toasted sesame seeds
- 20g Italian hard cheese
- 30g gochujang paste
- 15ml soy sauce
- 1 carrot
- 400g waxy potatoes
- 80g spinach
- 5g coriander
- 2 British free-range eggs
- 1/2 cucumber
- 2 spring onions

- **Replace suggested slaw with pickled (rice vinegar and sugar) cucumber and carrot, and a splash of sesame oil**

## Instructions:

- Boil a full kettle
  Chop the waxy potatoes in half
  Add the halved potatoes to a pot of plenty of boiled water with a pinch of salt and bring to the boil over a high heat
  Once boiling, cook for 12-15 min or until fork-tender, then drain and return to the pot and keep covered until later

- While the potatoes are cooking, top, tail, peel and grate the carrot[s]
- Combine the grated carrot with the quartered cucumber and pickle

- Trim, then slice the spring onions
  Heat a large, wide-based pan (with matching lid) with a generous drizzle of vegetable oil over a medium-high heat
  Once hot, add the sliced spring onion and cook for 1-2 min or until beginning to soften

- Meanwhile, combine the gochujang paste with the soy sauce and 2 tbsp [4 tbsp] cold water in a small bowl and mix well – this is your gochujang mixture
  Once the spring onions are soft, add the drained potatoes and gochujang mixture to the pan and cook for 4-5 min or until starting to brown

- Wash the spinach, then pat it dry with kitchen paper
  Once the potatoes have started to brown, add the spinach to the pan with a splash of water and cook, covered, for 1-2 min or until wilted
  Grate the Italian hard cheese

- Once the greens have wilted, crack the eggs over the potatoes, sprinkle over the grated Italian hard cheese and cook, covered, for 3-4 min or until the eggs are cooked through and the cheese has melted – these are your cheesy gochujang potatoes with fried egg
  Chop the coriander finely, including the stalks

- Serve the cheesy gochujang potatoes with fried egg with the tangy slaw to the side
  Garnish with the chopped coriander and toasted sesame seeds
