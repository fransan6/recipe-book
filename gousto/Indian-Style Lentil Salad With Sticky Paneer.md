**Cooking time:** 10 mins

## Ingredients:

- 1 tsp nigella seeds
- 1/2 tbsp curry powder
- 200g paneer
- 1 carrot
- 1 cooked black beluga lentils
- 50g baby leaf salad
- 30ml white wine vinegar
- 10g coriander & mint
- 1 cherry tomatoes
- 40g mango chutney

## Instructions:

- Grate your carrot[s] into a very large bowl
  Chop your cherry tomatoes roughly and add them to the bowl

- Squeeze your pouch[es] of beluga lentils to separate the grains
  Tear the top corner of the pouch[es] and microwave for 45 secs or until piping hot

- Heat a large, wide-based pan with a drizzle of vegetable oil over a medium heat
  Chop your paneer into bite-sized cubes
  Once hot, add the cubed paneer and curry powder and cook for 3 min, turning once halfway, until golden

- While the paneer is cooking, combine half your mango chutney with your white wine vinegar, 3 tbsp [4 1/2 tbsp] [6 tbsp] olive oil and a pinch of salt and pepper – this is your mango dressing
  Chop your coriander roughly, including the stalks
  Strip mint leaves from their stems and chop them roughly, discard the stems

- Increase the heat to high and add the remaining mango chutney and nigella seeds to the pan with the paneer
  Cook for a further 1 min or until sticky – this is your sticky paneer

- Wash your baby leaf salad, then pat it dry with kitchen paper
  Add the baby leaf salad, warmed lentils and mango dressing to the bowl with the grated carrot & halved cherry tomatoes and give everything a good mix up – this is your Indian-style lentil salad

- Serve the Indian-style lentil salad and top with the sticky paneer and the chopped coriander and mint
