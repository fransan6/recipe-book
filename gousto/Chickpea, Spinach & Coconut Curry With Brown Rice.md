# Chickpea, Spinach & Coconut Curry With Brown Rice

**Cooking time**: 10 mins

## Ingredients:

- 16g tomato paste
- 1 tbsp curry powder
- 390g chickpeas
- 280g cooked brown long grain rice
- 1 tsp ground turmeric
- 1 tsp nigella seeds
- 5.5g vegetable stock mix
- 15g ginger & garlic paste
- 50g solid creamed coconut
- 120g spinach
- 125g cherry tomatoes
- 20g mango chutney

## Instructions:

- Boil a kettle
  Chop the cherry tomatoes in half
  Drain and rinse the chickpeas
  Heat a large, wide-based pan with a generous drizzle of vegetable oil over a medium-high heat

- Once hot, add the ginger & garlic paste, curry powder, ground turmeric, tomato paste and drained chickpeas and cook for 1 min
  Meanwhile, dissolve the vegetable stock mix in 200ml [300ml] boiled water

- Add the halved cherry tomatoes to the pan and cook for 1 min or until softened
  Once the tomatoes have softened, add the vegetable stock to the pan and cook for 2 min further

- Meanwhile, squeeze the pouch[es] of cooked brown long grain rice to separate the grains
  Tear the top corner of the pouch[es] (just a little!) and microwave for 2 min or until piping hot

- Wash the spinach, then add it to a colander and pour boiled water all over it so that it starts to wilt
  Rinse the wilted spinach under cold running water until it's cool
  Once cool, squeeze as much of the water out of the spinach as you can, then chop it roughly

- Chop the creamed coconut roughly (if required)
  Turn the heat down to low and stir through the chopped creamed coconut and mango chutney
  Add the chopped spinach, season with a pinch of salt and a generous grind of black pepper and give everything a good mix up â€“ this is your chickpea, spinach & coconut curry

- Serve the chickpea, spinach & coconut curry over the brown rice
  Garnish with the nigella seeds
