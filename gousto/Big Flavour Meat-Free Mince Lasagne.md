# Big Flavour Meat-Free Mince Lasagne

**Cooking time:** 45 mins

## Ingredients:

- 32g tomato paste
- 11g vegetable stock mix
- 6 lasagne sheets
- 15ml Henderson's Relish
- 200g Meatless Farm mince
- 15ml balsamic vinegar
- 1 carrot
- 50g baby leaf salad
- 80g chestnut mushrooms
- 1 tbsp dried oregano
- 80g cheddar cheese
- 2 garlic cloves
- 1 brown onion
- butter
- flour
- milk

## Instructions:

- Preheat the oven to 220°C/ 200°C (fan)/ gas 7
  Peel and finely chop the brown onion[s]
  Top, tail, and finely dice the carrot[s]

- Heat a large, wide-based pan with a drizzle of olive oil over a medium heat
  Once hot, add the chopped onion and carrot with a generous pinch of salt and cook for 4 min or until softened
  Boil a kettle, then peel and finely chop (or grate) the garlic

- Once the onion and carrot have softened, add the meat-free mince to the pan and increase the heat to high
  Cook for 3-4 min or until beginning to brown, breaking it up with a wooden spoon as you go

- Dissolve the vegetable stock mix, tomato paste, Henderson's Relish and dried oregano in 350ml [650ml] boiled water – this is your tomato stock
  Grate the cheddar cheese

- Once the mince is browned, tear the chestnut mushrooms into the pan with your hands
  Add the chopped garlic and cook for 30 secs
  Add the tomato stock with a generous grind of black pepper and cook for 5-7 min or until thickened to a ragù-like consistency – this is your meat-free ragù

- Meanwhile, melt 20g [40g] butter in a pot over a medium heat
  Once melted, add 20g [40g] flour and stir with a wooden spoon for 1 min or until a sandy paste forms – this is your roux
  Add 250ml [500ml] milk gradually and whisk for 5 min or until a smooth, thick sauce remains
  Remove from the heat, season with salt and pepper and stir through half of the grated cheese – this is your béchamel

- Layer some of the meat-free ragù over the bottom of an oven-proof dish, then top with 3 lasagne sheets, being careful not to overlap the pasta
  Repeat this process until you end up with a final layer of lasagne sheets (you may need to layer differently depending on the size of your dish)
  Cover with the béchamel, top with the remaining grated cheese and cook in the oven for 30 min or until the pasta is cooked

- Combine the balsamic vinegar with 2 tbsp [4 tbsp] olive oil and a pinch of salt and pepper – this is your dressing
  Wash the baby leaf salad, then pat it dry with kitchen paper
