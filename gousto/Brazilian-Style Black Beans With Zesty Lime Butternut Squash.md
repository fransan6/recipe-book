**Cooking time:** 30 mins

## Ingredients:

- 1 red chilli
- 320g butternut squash cubes
- 390g black beans
- 130g brown rice
- 1 tsp ground cumin
- 5.5g vegetable stock mix
- 2 tsp smoked paprika
- 20g chipotle paste
- 5g coriander
- 20g mango chutney
- 1 spring onion
- 2 garlic cloves
- 1 lime
- 1 brown onion
- butter

## Instructions:

- Preheat the oven to 200°C/ 180°C (fan)/ gas 6
  Rinse your brown rice, then add it to a pot with plenty of cold water and bring to the boil over a high heat
  Once boiling, reduce the heat to medium and cook for 15-20 min or until it's tender with a slight bite
  Once cooked, drain and return it to the pot and keep covered until serving

- While the rice is cooking, add your butternut squash cubes to a baking tray with a generous drizzle of vegetable oil and a pinch of salt
  Give everything a good mix up and put the tray in the oven for 20-25 min or until tender and golden

- Peel and finely chop your brown onion[s]
  Heat a pot with a drizzle of vegetable oil and a knob of butter alternative over a medium heat
  Once hot, add the chopped onion with a pinch of salt and cook for 4-5 min or until softened

- Meanwhile, boil half a kettle
  Peel and finely chop (or grate) your garlic
  Dissolve your vegetable stock mix and your chipotle paste in 200ml [260ml] [350ml] boiled water – this is your chipotle stock

- Once the onion has softened, add the chopped garlic, smoked paprika and ground cumin to the pot and cook for 1 min or until fragrant
  Drain and rinse your black beans
  Once fragrant, add the drained black beans and chipotle stock and cook, covered for 5-7 min or until the beans are soft enough to mash

- While the black beans are cooking, chop your coriander including the stalks
  Cut your red chilli[es] in half lengthways and chop finely
  Trim, then slice your spring onion[s] finely
  Once the beans are done, add a generous knob of butter alternative and mash until smooth – these are your Brazilian-style black beans

- Once the butternut squash is tender, add it to a bowl with your mango chutney, sliced spring onion and chopped chilli
  Zest and juice half your lime[s] into the bowl and give everything a good mix up – this is your zesty lime butternut squash
  Cut the remaining lime into wedges

- Serve the Brazilian-style black beans over the brown rice and top with the zesty lime butternut squash
  Garnish with the coriander and a lime wedge
