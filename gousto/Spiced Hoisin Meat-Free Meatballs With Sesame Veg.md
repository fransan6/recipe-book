**Cooking time**: 35 mins

## Ingredients:

- 10g toasted sesame seeds
- 1 red chilli
- 15ml rice vinegar
- 130g white long grain rice
- 15g fresh root ginger
- 10ml toasted sesame oil
- 15ml soy sauce
- 200g Meatless Farm mince
- 1 carrot
- 80g hoisin sauce
- 80g spinach
- 3 spring onions
- 2 garlic cloves

## Instructions:

- Preheat the oven to 220°C/ 200°C (fan)/ gas 7
  Peel and grate (or finely chop) the garlic
  Peel and grate (or finely chop) the ginger
  Trim, then finely slice the spring onions

- Add the meat-free mince to a large mixing bowl with the grated garlic, 1/3 of the sliced spring onion and half of the grated ginger and mix thoroughly until combined
  Divide the meat-free mince mixture into 6 [12] and shape into meatballs
  Add the meat-free mince meatballs to a lightly oiled baking tray and put the tray in the oven for 12-15 min or until cooked through

- While the meat-free mince meatballs are in the oven, add the white long grain rice to a pot with a lid with 225ml [450ml] cold water and bring to the boil over a high heat
  Once boiling, reduce the heat to very low and cook, covered, for 12-15 min or until all the water has absorbed and the rice is cooked
  Once done, remove from the heat and set aside (lid on) to steam until serving

- While the rice is cooking, slice 1/4 of the red chilli[es] thinly so that you are left with chilli rounds
  Cut the remaining chilli in half lengthways, deseed (scrape the seeds out with a teaspoon) and chop finely
  Top, tail and peel the carrot[s], then continue to peel lengths until you end up with a pile of carrot ribbons

- Combine the hoisin sauce, rice vinegar, chopped chilli and a small splash of water in a small bowl
  Add the remaining grated ginger with 1 tsp [2 tsp] sugar and stir to combine – this is your spiced hoisin sauce
  Wash the spinach, then pat it dry with kitchen paper

- Heat a large, wide-based pan (preferably non-stick) with a drizzle of vegetable oil over a medium-high heat
  Once hot, add the spinach and cook for 1 min or until beginning to wilt
  Once wilted, remove the pan from the heat and add the toasted sesame oil, soy sauce, carrot ribbons and remaining sliced spring onion to the pan – this is your sesame veg

- Transfer the sesame veg to a plate and cover to keep warm
  Return the pan to a medium heat
  Remove the cooked meat-free mince meatballs from the oven and add them to the pan with the spiced hoisin sauce
  Cook for 2-3 min, coating the meat-free mince meatballs in the sauce until thickened and becoming sticky – these are your spiced hoisin meat-free mince meatballs

- Serve the spiced hoisin meat-free mince meatballs with the sesame veg and cooked rice to the side
  Spoon over the spiced hoisin sauce from the pan and garnish with the toasted sesame seeds and chilli rounds
