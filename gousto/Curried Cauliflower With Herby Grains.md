# Curried Cauliflower With Herby Grains

**Cooking time:** 30 mins

## Ingredients:

- 1 red chilli
- 185g canned green lentils
- 80g natural yoghurt
- 1/2 tsp ground turmeric
- 15ml cider vinegar
- 100g brown rice
- 1 cauliflower
- 80g spinach
- 10g coriander & mint
- 1 tbsp curry powder
- 25g cashew nuts
- 2 shallots
- 30g sultanas

## Instructions:

- Preheat the oven to 220°C/ 200°C (fan)/ gas 7
  Rinse the brown rice, add it to a pot with the sultanas and plenty of cold water and bring to the boil over a high heat
  Once boiling, reduce the heat to medium and cook for 15-20 min or until it's tender with a slight bite
  Once cooked, drain, return it to the pot and keep covered until serving – this is your sultana rice

- Whilst the rice is cooking, cut the cauliflower into small florets (save the leaves)
  Add the cauliflower florets to a bowl with the curry powder and a drizzle of vegetable oil and give it a good mix up – this is your curried cauliflower

- Add the curried cauliflower to a baking tray and put the tray[s] in the oven for 15-20 min or until tender
  Once the cauliflower is almost cooked, add the cashew nuts and cauliflower leaves to the tray[s] and return it to the oven for 3-4 min further or until the nuts are toasted

- While the cauliflower is cooking, peel, then slice the shallots as finely as you can
  Add the sliced shallots to a small bowl with the cider vinegar and a pinch of salt, then set aside to pickle – these are your quick-pickled shallots

- Meanwhile, strip the mint leaves from their stems and chop them roughly, discard the stems
  Chop the coriander roughly, including the stalks
  Cut the red chilli[es] in half lengthways and chop finely

- Combine the natural yoghurt with the ground turmeric, 1 tbsp [2 tbsp] of the pickling liquid from the shallots and a pinch of salt in a small bowl – this is your turmeric yoghurt dressing
  Drain and rinse the green lentils
  Wash the spinach, then pat it dry with kitchen paper

- Return the sultana rice to a medium heat and add the drained lentils and spinach
  Cook for 2-3 min or until warmed through and most of the spinach has wilted
  Remove the pot from the heat and add the chopped mint, coriander and chilli
  Drain the quick-pickled shallots and add them to the rice with a pinch of salt and stir it all together – these are your herby grains
