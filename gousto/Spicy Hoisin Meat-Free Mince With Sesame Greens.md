**Cooking time**: 25 mins

## Ingredients:

- 1 red chilli
- 1 tsp cornflour
- 130g white long grain rice
- 10ml toasted sesame oil
- 15ml soy sauce
- 200g Meatless Farm mince
- 15g ginger paste
- 40g hoisin sauce
- 80g fine green beans
- 80g mangetout
- 2 garlic cloves

## Instructions:

- Preheat the oven to 220°C/ 200°C (fan)/ gas 7
  Trim, then cut your green beans in half

- Cut a large piece of tin foil and lay your mangetout and green beans in the middle
  Add 1 tbsp [1 1/2 tbsp] [2 tbsp] cold water and scrunch the edges up to form a tightly sealed parcel[s], put the parcel[s] on a baking tray and put the tray in the oven for 10-12 min or until cooked

- Meanwhile, add your white long grain rice to a pot with a lid with 225ml [300ml] [450ml] cold water and bring to the boil over a high heat
  Once boiling, reduce the heat to very low and cook, covered, for 12-15 min or until all the water has absorbed and the rice is cooked
  Once done, remove from the heat and set aside (lid on) to steam until serving

- Heat a large, wide-based pan with a drizzle of vegetable oil over a high heat
  Once hot, add the meat-free mince and cook for 6-7 min or until starting to brown, breaking it up with a wooden spoon as you go

- Peel and finely chop (or grate) your garlic
  Finely slice half your red chilli[es] into rounds and set aside for garnish
  Chop the remaining chilli in half lengthways and chop finely

- Once the meat-free mince has browned, add the chopped garlic, ginger paste and chopped chilli to the pan and cook for 1 min
  Add your hoisin sauce, cornflour and soy sauce with 50ml [65ml] [75ml] water and cook for a further 4 min or until the sauce becomes sticky – this is your spicy hoisin meat-free mince

- Once the greens are done, remove the parcel[s] from the oven and drain away any excess water
  Add them to a bowl with your toasted sesame oil and stir to combine – these are your sesame greens

- Serve the spicy hoisin meat-free mince with the sesame greens and cooked rice to the side
  Garnish with the reserved chilli rounds
