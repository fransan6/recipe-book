**Cooking time:** 25 mins

## Ingredients:

- 390g green lentils
- 1 tsp turmeric
- 1 tsp nigella seeds
- 15g fresh root ginger
- 11g vegetable stock mix
- 50g solid creamed coconut
- 1 sweet potato
- 10g coriander
- 1 garlic clove
- 1 brown onion
- 1 lemon
- 100g red lentils

## Instructions:

- Preheat the oven to 200°C/ 180°C (fan)/ gas 6 and boil a kettle
  Peel and finely slice your brown onion[s]
  Peel and finely chop (or grate) your garlic
  Peel and chop (or grate) your ginger

- Heat a large, wide-based pan with a generous drizzle of vegetable oil over a medium heat
  Once hot, add half of the sliced onion with a pinch of salt and cook for 5 min or until softened

- Meanwhile, peel and chop your sweet potato[es] into bite-sized pieces
  Add the chopped sweet potato and the remaining sliced onion to a baking tray with a drizzle of vegetable oil
  Season with a pinch of salt and give everything a good mix up
  Put the tray in the oven and cook for 15-20 min or until tender and golden – this is your roasted sweet potato & onion

- While the sweet potato is roasting, chop your creamed coconut roughly (if required)
  Dissolve your vegetable stock mix and creamed coconut in 450ml [585ml] [765ml] boiled water – this is your coconut stock
  Rinse your red lentils in a sieve under cold running water

- Once the onion has softened, add your ground turmeric, chopped garlic and chopped ginger to the pan and cook for 1-2 min or until fragrant

- Once fragrant, add the rinsed red lentils and your green lentils to the pan
  Add the coconut stock and cook, stirring frequently, for 15-20 min or until all the water has absorbed and the lentils are tender

- While the lentils are cooking, pick the coriander leaves from their stems and chop them roughly, discard the stems
  Cut your lemon[s] in half
  Once the lentils are cooked, stir through half of the chopped coriander and add a squeeze of lemon juice – this is your coconut dal

- Cut the remaining lemon into 1 wedge per person
  Top the coconut dal with the roasted sweet potato & onion
  Garnish with the remaining chopped coriander, your nigella seeds and a lemon wedge to the side
