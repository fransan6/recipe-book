# Butternut Squash Dal With Coconut Raita

**Cooking time:** 10 mins

## Ingredients:

- 1 red chilli
- 2 wholemeal pittas
- 80g cultured coconut
- 3.8g black mustard seeds
- 1 tbsp curry powder
- 160g butternut squash cubes
- 390g green lentils
- 20g mint sauce
- 5.5g vegetable stock mix
- 15g ginger & garlic paste
- 25g solid creamed coconut
- 2 cardamom pods
- 80g spinach

## Instructions:

- Add the butternut squash cubes to a heatproof bowl
  Cover the bowl with cling film and pierce a few holes in the top
  Put the bowl in the microwave and cook for 3-4 min or until the butternut squash cubes are fork-tender

- Meanwhile, boil half a kettle
  Heat a large, wide-based pan with 1 tbsp [2 tbsp] vegetable oil over a medium heat
  Crush the cardamom pods open by squashing them with the side of a knife
  Once hot, add the black mustard seeds to the pan along with the ginger & garlic paste, curry powder and crushed cardamom pods and cook for 1-2 min or until fragrant

- Chop the creamed coconut roughly (if required)
  Dissolve the vegetable stock mix and the chopped creamed coconut in 200ml [350ml] boiled water – this is your coconut stock
  Drain and rinse the green lentils

- Once fragrant, add the drained lentils and coconut stock to the pan and cook for 1-2 min further
  Add the wholemeal pittas to the toaster for 1-2 min or until warmed through

- Once the butternut squash is fork-tender, roughly mash it with a fork
  Wash the spinach, then pat dry with kitchen paper
  Add the spinach to the pan along with the mashed butternut squash and give everything a good mix up
  Cook for 2-3 min until all the spinach has wilted and the sauce has thickened – this is your butternut squash dal

- Meanwhile, add the cultured coconut and mint sauce to a bowl and mix it all together – this is your coconut raita
  Slice the red chilli[es] finely

- Slice the warmed pittas into triangles
  Serve the butternut squash dal in bowls with the coconut raita and pitta triangles to the side
  Tip: Watch out for any cardamom pods!
  Garnish with the chilli rounds
  Enjoy!
